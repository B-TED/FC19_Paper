\section{Introduction}          
\subsection{Background}
Eliminating the trusted party in realizing network based services is one of 
the biggest dreams in financial cryptographic research, hence this is the main subject in this world. 
The main reason why we seek
to eliminate the trusted party is, it is too difficult to realize expected trusted party. Such difficulties are caused by operator's mistakes, malicious activities and 
collusion with other parties. Many cryptographic techniques like secret sharing scheme, threshold cryptography and multi party computation
protocol are well studied to realize many network based services without trusted parties. 
The sentence, ``An electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party.'' is the explanation of Bitcoin - one of the most attractive cryptographic protocols - described in 
the original paper~\cite{N08}. Bitcoin is the one of the most excellent cryptographic protocols which 
claimed to realize payment scheme among cryptographic protocols which try to eliminate the trusted party.

In spite of this attractive claim of Bitcoin, there is a fundamental assumption in the claim. That is, it holds only when the payment is conducted by 
Bitcoin, and no exchange to any other payment methods exits.
