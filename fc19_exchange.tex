\begin{abstract}
After the original publication of the Bitcoin paper~\cite{N08}, cryptocurrency exchange was born to connect the cryptocurrency world 
to fiat currency world. Although most persons believe that the cryptocurrency exchange plays the simple role of exchange, 
several security incidents raise a big question on the reality of the cryptocurrency exchange. That is, what kinds of operations
are conducted, whats are the informational asset to be protected, and what kinds of security postures are required.

In this paper, we report the results of investigation of 16 registered and 16 quasi-registered cryptocurrency
exchanges by Japanese regulators, then analyze the reality of functionalities, implementation and operations of real cryptocurrency exchanges.
Then, we conduct analysis from the information security management system (ISMS) standard point of views, to clarify
the required actions to secure the implementation and operation of cryptocurrency exchanges. They includes analysis on
blockchain protocol, cryptographic key management, system security, and operation. We shows the current activities in IETF and 
ISO to have a common document on security of cryptocurrency exchange.

{\bf Keywords:} Cryptocurrency exchange, Information security management, Standards
